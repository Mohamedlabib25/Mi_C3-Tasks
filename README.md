# Mi_C3-Tasks: FastAPI Time Difference API

This FastAPI application calculates the absolute time differences between timestamp pairs provided in plain text input. It processes these timestamp pairs, computes the differences in seconds, and returns the results in JSON format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install fastapi uvicorn
Running the FastAPI Application
To run the FastAPI app locally, use uvicorn:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn main:app --reload
Testing the API
You can test the API by sending a POST request to the /compute-differences endpoint with the timestamp pairs in the request body. To do this, follow these steps:

Open PowerShell.

Run the following script to send a POST request with timestamp pairs:

powershell

Edit
$body = "2`nSun 10 May 2015 13:54:36 -0700`nSun 10 May 2015 13:54:36 -0000`nSat 02 May 2015 19:54:36 +0530`nFri 01 May 2026 13:54:36 -0000"
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/compute-differences' -Method POST -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "text/plain" } -Body $body).content
Expected Output
The expected output will be a JSON array with the time differences in seconds:
